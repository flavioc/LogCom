Now that we have presented both the HLD and LLD semantics, we are in position to start building our soundness theorem.
The soundness theorem proves that if a rule was successfully derived in the LLD semantics then it can also be derived
in the HLD semantics. Since the HLD semantics are so close to linear logic, we prove that our language has a determined, correct,
proof search behavior when executing programs. However, the completeness theorem cannot be proven since LLD lacks the non-determinism
inherent in HLD.


First and foremost, we need to prove some auxiliary theorems and definitions that will be used during the soundness theorem.
